abstract: I study how regions respond to price shocks when there is internal migration. I examine Indonesia in the 2000s as it faced both a commodity boom and initiated its import restrictions on rice, a staple food for its large population. I measure exposure to shocks using the variation in the importance of palm-oil and rice across district economies. I find that districts exposed to palm-oil price shocks have significantly higher expenditure per capita and hence receive more migration. However, exposure to rice price shocks did not materialize as higher purchasing power to exposed districts. I estimate that the overall welfare increased by 0.39% in Indonesia over the period of 2005 to 2010, with one third of the increase is accounted for internal migration.
