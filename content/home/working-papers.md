#### **Global Prices, Trade Protection, and Internal Migration: Evidence from Indonesia**
{{% staticref "files/Rizki Siregar - JMP.pdf" %}}_[Job Market Paper]_{{% /staticref %}}

_Abstract_: I study how regions respond to price shocks in the presence of internal migration. I examine Indonesia in the 2000s as it faced a commodity boom and initiated its trade protection on rice, a staple food for its large population. I use the variation in the potential shares of palm oil and rice sectors across district economies to measure local exposure to shocks. I find that districts exposed to palm oil price shocks had temporarily higher real expenditure per capita compared to the non-exposed ones. These exposed districts also received more migration, providing the evidence that palm oil price shocks were no longer localized. Meanwhile, exposure to rice price shocks did not materialize as higher purchasing power to exposed districts compared to the non-exposed ones. I estimate that the overall welfare increased by 0.39% in Indonesia between 2005 and 2010, and one third of the increase can be accounted for by internal migration.s
