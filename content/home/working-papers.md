#### **Global Prices, Trade Protection, and Internal Migration: Evidence from Indonesia**
{{% staticref "files/Rizki Siregar - JMP.pdf" %}}_[Job Market Paper]_{{% /staticref %}}

_Abstract_: I study how regions respond to price shocks in the presence of internal migration. I examine Indonesia in the 2000s as it faced both a commodity boom and initiated its import restrictions on rice, a staple food for its large population. I measure exposure to shocks using the variation in the importance of palm-oil and rice across district economies. I find that districts exposed to palm-oil price shocks had temporarily higher expenditure per capita. Hence, they received more migration. However, exposure to rice price shocks did not materialize as higher purchasing power to exposed districts. I estimate that the overall welfare increased by 0.39% in Indonesia over the period of 2005 to 2010, with one third of the increase is accounted for internal migration.
