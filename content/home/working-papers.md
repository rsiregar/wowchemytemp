#### **Global Prices and Internal Migration: Evidence from the Palm Oil Boom in Indonesia**
{{% staticref "files/Rizki Siregar - palm oil.pdf" %}}_[Job Market Paper]_{{% /staticref %}}, previously titled "Global Prices, Trade Protection, and Internal Migration: Evidence from Indonesia"

_Abstract_: I study how regions respond to price shocks in the presence of internal migration. I examine Indonesia in the 2000s as it faced a commodity boom for palm oil, which became one of its main export commodities. I exploit the variation in the land shares and crop suitability to compute the potential contribution of main crops across district economies as a measure of local exposure to shocks. I find that the commodity boom increased the purchasing power of palm oil-producing districts. These districts also received more migration, providing evidence that palm oil price shocks were no longer localized. Indeed, internal migration spread the windfall. I also find spillover to neighboring districts. However, these relatively higher levels of purchasing power did not last after the commodity boom ended in 2014. I show that the palm-oil sector grew through extensification as a response to the price shocks, with no indication of growth through intensification. I estimate the overall welfare gains in Indonesia between 2005 and 2010 and find substantial gains from migration.
